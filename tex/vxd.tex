\chapter{Momentum estimation of slow pions with the ADC in the VXD}

\section{Prestudies}

Hit Positions
Path Length calculation (different possibilities: mc seed, tracking seed, mc particle at hit position)
dEdX with calibration
dEdX with p + fit on data + correction + q/p residdum etc.

Pictures:
- Event-Display with pions
- Finding-Efficiency of VXDTF
- path length drawing

- Path Lengths with different infromation
- dedx with different pathlengths + delta
- fit result for landau (both plots),
- residuum, median + iqr function


\section{Incooperation in the helix fit}

MeasurementCreator, State On Plane -> TrackPoint

Results with fit, p value, iqr, median

Pictures:
- residuum, median + iqr function for different path length calculations
- p values
