\chapter{Momentum estimation of slow pions with the ADC in the VXD}

\section{Prestudies}

Hit Positions
Path Length calculation (different possibilities: mc_seed, tracking_seed, mc_particle at hit position)
dEdX with calibration
dEdX with p + fit on data + correction + q/p residdum etc.

Pictures:
- Event-Display with pions
- Finding-Efficiency of VXDTF
- Cluster Stuff: Hit-Positions, Cluster Thickness, Cluster Charge (also PXD - SVD)
- path length drawing
- Path Lengths with different infromation
- dedx with different pathlengths + delta
- dedx over p, p distr for different dedx bins
- fit result for landau (both plots),
- residuum, median + iqr function


\section{Incooperation in the helix fit}

MeasurementCreator, State On Plane -> TrackPoint

Results with fit, p value, iqr, median

Pictures:
- residuum, median + iqr function for different path length calculations
- p values
