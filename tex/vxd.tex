\chapter{Momentum estimation of slow pions with the ADC in the VXD}

When looking onto the typical momentum distribution of the particles flying through the tracking detectors as show in figure \ref{fig-particles-momentum} it is clear that there is a significant amount of so called slow pions with momenta below $\unit[120]{MeV}$. These particles get produced at the interaction point but because of their small momentum and therefore high curvature and their huge energy losses they can not be detected in the CDC tracking detector. This means they can only be measured in the VXD. Because of the small radius of the VXD and the resulting small number of independent measurement points, the momentum resolution is very poor as it can be seen also in the GlÃ¼ckstern formula \todo{quote?}

\begin{align*}
 \frac{\sigma_{p_T}}{p_T} = \sqrt{\frac{720}{N + 4}} \sigma_x \frac{p_T \text{[GeV]}}{0.3 q B \text{[T]} L^2}
\end{align*}
where L is the length of the track in the detector and $N$ is the number of measurement points. Decreasing the magnetic field would increase the curvature of the low momentum pions and would therefore make them detectable in the CDC also increasing the number of measurement points. But this would also make the resolution of the high momentum particles very difficult. In this thesis a different approach is chosen. Together with the measured positions an independent momentum estimation based on the energy loss per length of the particles is introduced and used in the fit. These added measurements bias the fit towards the correct momentum and can therefore help to increase the momentum resolution.

As it was shown in previous studies \cite{robert}, the momentum resolution compared to the result of the helix fit with the positions only can be increased by using the information from the energy loss of all hits in the track together. In the quoted paper an advanced summation was used to build a mean energy loss of the slow pions which was transformed to a momentum by a precalculated formula. This momentum estimation was then compared to the one coming from the helix fit. To increase the resolution even more the two different approaches are combined in the presented algorithm.

In figure \ref{fig-dedx-over-p} the energy loss per travel length in the VXD sensors for low momentum pions is used. How these numbers are calculated is described in the next sections. As it can be seen the \dedx increases with falling momentum of the particles. This relation can be also seen in the already quoted Bethe formula \ref{form-bethe} in chapter \ref{chapter-ex} which can be reduced to 
\begin{align*}
 -\left \langle \dd{E}{x} \right\rangle \approx \frac{4 \pi n z^2}{m_e v^2} \left( \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \right)^2 \ln \left( \frac{2 m_e v^2}{I} \right)
\end{align*} \todo{see in chapter 1: described mean?}
for small particle energies. This relation can be used to calculate the momentum with the energy loss per travel length. But as thus formula describes the averaged energy loss only it is not correct for all cases. The variance in the energy loss is distributed according to a landau distribution which is described later in more detail. This deviation from the Bethe formula decreases the momentum resolution of the estimation based on the energy loss.

The distribution of energy losses for a given momentum is distributed according to a landau distribution which can be seen in the right sub figure for particles with roughly 100 MeV.}
