\chapter{Momentum estimation of slow pions with the ADC in the VXD}

Distribution of momentum + particle
Why is helix fit not good enough
Quote Robert
Why does dEdX have information in it?

dEdX over p picture

Idea: Use hit positions + momentum estimation from dEdX for fit.
For dEdX we need: dE = ADC count, dX = path length
Transform dEdX -> p with predetermined function

\section{Prestudies on the distribution of dE/dX in the VXD}



Prestudies to show that the information from the calculation is correct
Which sample is used


Pictures:
- Event-Display with pions
- Finding-Efficiency of VXDTF

Cluster positions

\subsection{Calculation of the path length in the clusters}
How to calculate the path length?
Thickness, Seed at origin (TF + MC), MC Hit Information = state while fitting

- Path Lengths with different infromation

\subsection{Transformation function from dE/dX to momentum}

dEdX with calibration
Calculation of the function + calibration?
dEdX with p + fit on data + correction + q/p residdum etc.

- dedx with different pathlengths + delta
- fit result for landau (both plots),
- residuum, median + iqr function

\section{Incooperation in the helix fit}

MeasurementCreator, State On Plane -> TrackPoint

Results with fit, p value, iqr, median

Pictures:
- residuum, median + iqr function for different path length calculations
- p values
