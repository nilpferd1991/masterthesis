\chapter{Experimental Setup} \label{chapter-ex}
In the following sections the experimental setup for this thesis - the Belle II detector and the SuperKEKB collider - are described as far as it is necessary for the tracking software. Detailed information can be found elsewhere \cite{tdr}.


\section{SuperKEKB and the Belle II Detector}

The future Belle II is currently being build at the KEK high energy research facility in Tsukuba, Japan. It is a general purpose $4\pi$ detector for high energy particle experiments. A scheme of the whole detector with the planned measuring devices can be found in figure \ref{fig-belle2}.

The Belle II detector is used for measuring the electron positron collisions induced by the two-ring asymmetric-energy SuperKEKB collider. A sketch of the collider can be found in figure \ref{fig-superkekb}. As its predecessor KEKB its center of mass energy is tuned in such a way that it lays near the $\PgUc$ resonance. This beam energy is chosen because a $\PgUc$ particle decays with a branching fraction of 96 \% into a pair of entangled B-mesons. As described in the introduction, the daughter particles of these B mesons open a window to a very wide range of physical studies like CP violation or meson spectroscopy. The energy of the colliding electrons and positrons is asymmetric which leads to a slightly asymmetric collision as well. This fact is exploited in measuring the decay length of the two formed B-Mesons - one of the main ingredients for quantifying the CP violation in the B-Meson system. 

The usage of electrons and their antiparticles for collisions leads to very clean events compared to other collision partners like protons or even gold atoms. Clean means in this context that a reduced number of created decay products (only 11 charged tracks on average) and no pile up (only one collision occurring at the same time) are expected. These circumstances can be used for high precision measurements on the formed particles.

As every general purpose high energy particle physics detector the Belle II detector is composed of several single measuring devices - each one with a different task. The detector consists of basically six measurement layers:
\begin{zlist}
  \item two layers of silicon pixel detectors for measuring the charged particles near the interaction point (PXD),
  \item another four layers of doubled-sided silicon strip layers (SVD),
  \item the central drift chamber (CDC) for measuring the momentum of charged particles,
  \item a time-of-propagation counter (TOP) together with the endcap particle identification detector (aerogel ring imaging Cherenkov detector) for identification of the produced particles using Cherenkov radiation,
  \item an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECL) build of scintillating CsI(Tl) crystals for measuring the energy of all electromagnetic interacting particles,
  \item and the longliving kaon and myon detector (KLM) identifying these particle types in the outer region of the detector to improve the overall particle identification.
\end{zlist}

\section{The Tracking Detectors}

For collecting many information on the physical process in the collision, many information on the created decay products are needed. These include
\begin{zlist}
 \item Identification of the created particles (for example by their mass),
 \item Measurement of the kinematic properties (like momentum and energy) of the charged particles,
 \item Resolution of their origin position - also called their vertex.
\end{zlist}

The tracking detectors described in this thesis are mainly build for recording the momenta of the particles as well as the position of their trajectories. The position information can then be further used for combining two or more particles which originate from the same particle for measuring the vertex position. %Further more special applications are identification of the particle type by their energy loss.

The measuring principle of the positions and also the momenta of charged decay products is to let the particles fly throw a sensor region with space-resolved measurement and obtain their full path through the detector - a so called track - by combining the different location information - the so called hits. By applying a magnetic field - in Belle II it has a nominal field strength of $B = \unit[1.5]{T}$ - parallel to the beam axis which is the $z$ axis in the coordinate system of the detector, the charged particles curl. By measuring the curvature of the curled tracks an estimation of the momentum in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis - the $r$-$\phi$-plane - can be made. The remaining $z$-direction parallel to the beam axis can be computed with the angle of the track to the beam axis\footnote{The coordinate system in Belle II is chosen as the typical one in high energy particle physics: The $z$-axis is parallel to the beam whereas the $x$- and $y$-axis span a plane perpendicular to the beam line. The origin is the interaction point. Most of the time, one uses $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\phi = \arctan(y/x)$ rather than $x$ and $y$ directly.}.

There exist many different ways to measure the position of a charged particle. Each of them exploits the charge of the particles and their interaction with materials which makes these techniques unusable for neutral particles. The vertex positions and momenta of uncharged particles can not be measured with the here presented methods. In Belle II the momenta of neutral particles are resolved by assuming momentum conservation or by measuring the total energy of the particles in the calorimeter\footnote{Photons for example are neutral particles but deposit energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter as well.}. In the following two tracking devices for charged particles are described in more detail. The main part (chapters \ref{chapter-theory}, \ref{chapter-workflow} and \ref{chapter-results}) of this thesis covers the tracking in the CDC detector. Only chapter \ref{chapter-vxd} on the VXD momentum estimation for slow pions handles the tracking in the VXD detectors.

\subsection{CDC}

CDC is an acronym for Central Drift Chamber and with its radius of about $\unit[1.3]{m}$ the largest tracking detector in Belle 2. The CDC is a typical gas chamber detector with 14336 sense wires arranged in 56 layer and 9 superlayers. These sense wires together with a much larger number of field wires are strained mostly parallel to the beam axis in a cylindrical tank flooded with gas which spreads the whole detector in $z$-direction. The gas is a mixture of 50 \% helium and 50 \% ethane. For more information on gas chamber detectors see for example \cite{grupen}.

Each charged particle produced in the collision of the electron and position with a transversal momentum high enough to exit the inner VXD detectors, interacts with the gas and can ionize the helium atoms. The energy deposit of a charged particle is given by the Bethe formula \cite{bethe}
\begin{align}
 - \left\langle \dd{E}{x} \right\rangle = \frac{4 \pi n z^2}{m_e c^2 \beta^2} \cdot \left( \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \right)^2 \left[ \ln\left( \frac{2 m_e c^2 \beta^2}{I(1 - \beta^2} \right) - \beta^2 \right] \ , \label{form-bethe}
\end{align}
which describes the average energy loss per travel length. This energy is transfered to the shell electrons of the helium gas atoms. As the ionization energy of helium is very low (about $\unit[20]{eV}$) the helium atoms release their electrons very easily. These free electrons get accelerated in an electric field. This electric field is induced by applying a high voltage between sense and field wires. An instructive simulation of the typical electronic field distribution between 7 sense wires and 34 field wires can be found in figure \ref{fig-sense-wires}. The direction of the electric field is chosen that the field strength near the sense wires increases with $\propto 1/r$. The energy of the free electrons increases there rapidly so that they can ionize helium atoms by themselves as well. This whole ``flood'' of free charge can be detected by the electronics attaches to the sense wires and produce a sharp peak there. The more immobile helium atomic cores get absorbed later by the field wires. 

Because the free electrons have to drift through the gas, the measured peak has a delay up to $\unit[500]{ns}$ for the largest drift cells to the initial charged particle passage. By analyzing the time and location information of each measured peak, the path of the charged particle through the CDC can be reconstructed. A typical event display of the simulated passage of ten charged pions with $\unit[1]{GeV}$ can be seen in figure \ref{fig-event-display}. As the electric charge configuration in each drift cell is almost rotationally symmetric, there is no way to obtain information on the direction of the electron flood hitting the sense wire. Each wire produces a so called drift circle rather than a single hit point. These drift circles can also be seen in the figure.

If all CDC wires were strained perfectly parallel to the beam axis in $z$-direction, there would be no possibility to measure the $z$-information like the angle between the charged particles and the beam axis. That is the reason why some of the wires are installed with a small tilting angle to the beam axis\footnote{More correct is that these wires get twisted not tilted, but as the twisting angle is small, there is not much difference in the two descriptions.}. These wires are called stereo wires in contrast to the axial wires without tilting angle. A measured hit on the stereo wires alone does not give information neither on the position along the beam axis nor in the layer parallel to it as there is no possibility to measure the position along the wire where the particle passed by. Only the information collected among all axial and stereo hits lead to a correct estimation of the momentum in all directions as the axial wires define the position on the $r$-$\phi$-plane which in turn can be used to calculate the $z$-information with the stereo wires. A sketch of some axial and stereo wires sharing the same distance from the beam axis - also called a layer of wires - are shown in \ref{fig-axial-stereo}.

The wires are shown as gray (stereo) or black (axial) points. The hit wires are depicted with their drift circles. The appearing disruption in the circular paths of the particle arise due to the tilting angle of the stereo wires in respect to the axial wires.}

\subsection{VXD}
VXD stands for vertex detectors and describes a group of two sorts of detectors: the pixel vertex detector (PXD) and the strip vertex detector (SVD). These two detectors are the innermost tracking detectors and are therefore used for measuring low momentum particles that do not reach into the CDC and the vertex positions of all produced decay products. 

The PXD consists of two layers of over eight million depleted field effect transistor pixels made of silicon. Because of their large number the occupancy is below 1 \% so their long readout time of over $\unit[20]{\mu s}$ can be handled better. \todo{size, form -> later, describe measurement system, describe energy loss -> later} 

The SVD is build of 4 layers of double-sided silicon strips todo{size, form -> later}. Its measurement system is comparable to the pixel detectors described before. As it can be seen in figure \ref{fig-belle2} the strips in the forward direction of the detector are constructed with a small slope of about $15^\circ$ because in this direction the bigger part of the decay products is expected. The found tracks in the SVD can be used to connect the results from the CDC and the PXD. Also because of the much smaller readout time in the SVD one can use it to improve the tracking in the pixel detector.
