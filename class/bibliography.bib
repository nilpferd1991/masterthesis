abstract = {Perturbation of a beamby an obstacle in the beampath is a well-known problem. Monitoring devices to determine beam parameters or stripping foils to change the charge state of ions are placed in the beam path and cause energy loss and scattering processes. This note describes these processes in the framework of covariance matrices, which makes no a priori assumption of the actual phase space distribution and is applicable to a variety of processes involving changes in particle position and angle. Exact compact expressions are derived whose series expansions yield the usual approximate expressions for increase in beam emittance and change in Twiss parameters. A numerical example is given for the case of scattering and compared with results derived from a corresponding Monte Carlo calculation.},

The proposed ultra-fast source would be intrinsically temporally synchronized to the drive laser pulse, enabling pump-probe studies in ultra-fast science with pulse lengths of tens of fs. Owing to the high current ( 10 kA) of the laser-plasma-accelerated electron beams, saturated output fluxes are potentially greater than 1013 photons/pulse. Devices based both on SASE and high-harmonic generated input seeds, to reduce undulator length and fluctuations, are considered.},

abstract = {Laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs) emit electrons with energies of a few 100 MeV at very short bunch lengths while having a compact design. However, electron bunches from LWFAs show a larger energy spread than those of conventional accelerators. This is a challenge when using these bunches e.g. to generate radiation in an undulator. A possible strategy to cope with that is to spectrally dis- perse the bunch and match the resulting spatial distribution with an undulator field amplitude varying in the dispersion plane. For realizing the dispersion a pair of dipole magnets is used. The electrons leaving this dipole chicane have to meet certain requirements imposed by the undulator: In the deflection plane the beam has to be collimated and its energy distribution must match the undulator field. In the other transversal plane the beam has to be focused to the center of the undulator, keeping the value of the beta function small. To include this in the compact design of the whole setup, a combination of specially designed quadrupole and sextupole magnets is employed. In this contribution the design of the setup of this chicane is pre- sented.},

The energy spread of the electron beam, however is relatively large. In order to obtain monochromatic photons in an undulator despite the energy spread, the following idea was proposed. Two bend- ing magnets and a drift space in between produce disper- sion so that particles with different energies have different transverse positions. The beam enters a non-planar undula- tor, e.g. cylindrical pole geometry, where the K-value also varies with transverse position. If the two variations in the transverse direction (particle energy and K-value) compen- sate each other the generated light is more monochromatic than with a conventional planar undulator. In this paper such a modified undulator design optimized for the JETI-LWFA in Jena is presented. An experiment to test this concept is in preparation.},

abstract = {The transport and matching of electron beams generated by a LaserWakefield Accelerator (LWFA) is a major chal- lenge due to their large energy spread and divergence. The divergence in the range of one milli-radian at energies of some 100MeV calls for strong focusing magnets. At the same time a chromatic correction of the magnets is needed due to the relative energy spread of a few percent. This contribution discusses in particular the layout of the beam transport optics for a diagnostic beam-line at the LWFA using the JETI laser in Jena, Germany. The aim of this optics is to match the betatron functions and the non- zero dispersion to the x-dependent flux density amplitude of a non-planar undulator such that monochromatic undu- lator radiation is generated despite the large energy spread. The transport line is realized as a dogleg chicane involv- ing several strong focusing quadrupoles. The chromatic er- ror is compensated by additional sextupoles. To keep the setup as compact as possible the magnets are designed as combined function magnets. In this contribution the design and optimization of the transport optics, as well as their realization are presented.},

The working principle of undulators requires a small energy spread of the electron beam in the order of $\Delta$E/E \~{} 0.1\%. Laser-wakefield accelerators can produce electron bunches with an energy of several 100 MeV within a few millimeters acceleration length, but with a relatively large energy spread ($\Delta$E/E \~{} 1-10\%). In order to produce monochromatic undulator radiation with these electrons, a novel scheme involving transverse-gradient superconducting undulators was proposed in an earlier work.

Recent progress in laser wakefield accelerators has resulted in electron beams with energies from tens of mega-electron volts (refs 5,6,7) to more than 1 GeV within a few centimetres8, with pulse durations predicted to be several femtoseconds9. The enormous progress in improving beam quality and stability5, 6, 7, 8, 10 makes them serious candidates for driving the next generation of ultracompact light sources11. Here, we demonstrate the first successful combination of a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator, producing 55–75 MeV electron bunches, with an undulator to generate visible synchrotron radiation.

This process involves passing a high-energy, high-charge, short-pulse, low-energy-spread, and low-emittance electron beam through the periodic magnetic field of a long series of high-quality undulator magnets. The radiation produced grows exponentially in intensity until it reaches a saturation point. We report on the demonstration of self-amplified spontaneous emission gain, exponential growth, and saturation at visible (530 nanometers) and ultraviolet (385 nanometers) wavelengths. Good agreement between theory and simulation indicates that scaling to much shorter wavelengths may be possible. These results confirm the physics behind the self-amplified spontaneous emission process and forward the development of an operational x-ray free-electron laser.},

abstract = {Synchrotrons and free-electron lasers are the most powerful sources of X-ray radiation. They constitute invaluable tools for a broad range of research1; however, their dependence on large-scale radiofrequency electron accelerators means that only a few of these sources exist worldwide. Laser-driven plasma-wave accelerators2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 provide markedly increased accelerating fields and hence offer the potential to shrink the size and cost of these X-ray sources to the university-laboratory scale. Here, we demonstrate the generation of soft-X-ray undulator radiation with laser-plasma-accelerated electron beams. The well-collimated beams deliver soft-X-ray pulses with an expected pulse duration of \~{}10 fs (inferred from plasma-accelerator physics). Our source draws on a 30-cm-long undulator11 and a 1.5-cm-long accelerator delivering stable electron beams10 with energies of \~{}210 MeV. The spectrum of the generated undulator radiation typically consists of a main peak centred at a wavelength of \~{}18 nm (fundamental), a second peak near \~{}9 nm (second harmonic) and a high-energy cutoff at \~{}7 nm. Magnetic quadrupole lenses11 ensure efficient electron-beam transport and demonstrate an enabling technology for reproducible generation of tunable undulator radiation. The source is scalable to shorter wavelengths by increasing the electron energy. Our results open the prospect of tunable, brilliant, ultrashort-pulsed X-ray sources for small-scale laboratories.},

abstract = {GeV electron accelerators are essential to synchrotron radiation facilities and free electron lasers, and as modules for high-energy particle physics. Radio frequency based accelerators are limited to relatively low accelerating fields (10-50 MV/m) and hence require tens to hundreds of metres to reach the multi-GeV beam energies needed to drive radiation sources, and many kilometres to generate particle energies of interest to the frontiers of high-energy physics. Laser wakefield accelerators (LWFA) in which particles are accelerated by the field of a plasma wave driven by an intense laser pulse produce electric fields several orders of magnitude stronger (10-100 GV/m) and so offer the potential of very compact devices. However, until now it has not been possible to maintain the required laser intensity, and hence acceleration, over the several centimetres needed to reach GeV energies. For this reason laser-driven accelerators have to date been limited to the 100 MeV scale. Contrary to predictions that PW-class lasers would be needed to reach GeV energies, here we demonstrate production of a high-quality electron beam with 1 GeV energy by channelling a 40 TW peak power laser pulse in a 3.3 cm long gas-filled capillary discharge waveguide. We anticipate that laser-plasma accelerators based on capillary discharge waveguides will have a major impact on the development of future femtosecond radiation sources such as x-ray free electron lasers and become a standard building block for next generation high- energy accelerators.},
